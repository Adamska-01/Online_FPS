# Army's Heaven

Army's Heaven is a Single Player/Multiplayer FPS game that utilizes PUN2 (Photon Unity Package) for its multiplayer backend. This game started as a multiplayer project and currently has a deathmatch mode and 2 different maps to choose from.

I am currently focusing on the single player mode that will provide a campaign of a few hours, and introduce all the mechanics that I will transfer back in the multiplayer mode (such as the new character controller, guns, and shooting mechanics).

If you would like to try the current version of the game, you can find it on Itch.io at the following link: https://salvg.itch.io/armys-heaven

### Software/Plug-ins used
* Unity 3D/C#
* Photon (PUN2)
* Final IK by RootMotion (Might not need it anymore with the new FPS controller)
